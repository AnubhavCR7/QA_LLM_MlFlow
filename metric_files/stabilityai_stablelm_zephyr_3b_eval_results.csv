What is the galaxy nearest to our galaxy ?,"The nearest major galaxy to the Milky Way is the Andromeda Galaxy (M31), which is about 2.5 million light-years away. However, the closest known galaxy overall is the Canis Major Dwarf Galaxy, located approximately 25,000 light-years from our Solar System.","As of my last update on September 24, 2021, the closest known galactic neighbor relative to ours in the Local Group (a group that includes galaxies such as Andromeda and Triangulum) depends somewhat upon how you define ""nearest."" 

If we consider only individual stars within a distanceof 25 million light-years from Earthâ€”which covers most distances explored by modern telescopes â€”the likely candidates are either Proxima Centauri or Epsilon Seriguidum. A study published August 10th 2020 identified these two star systems based primarily their proximity but also because they appear relatively bright compared with other nearby objects allowing for good quality observations using current technology like adaptive optics devices mounted atop ground observatories which can remove atmospheric distortion effects while viewing distant targets through large telescope mirrors; this allows researchers at Gaia's data analysis center located near Paris France called CNES/GPS PlanetQuest Lab & Data System Center led by Thierry Moulines et al., along withe astronomers working there including Pascal FellemÃ© who were able confirm both sources' identification via follow up astroimaging work conducted since then confirming them definitively beyond any reasonable doubt given high precision measurements obtained during those studies about each objectâ€™s parallax position against background celestial coordinates taken over several years between 2014â€“2018 period under observation programs run globally across multiple continents simultaneously monitored around every clock hour day nightly basis thanks largely due to space missions designed specifically dedicated observing tasks -Proximena eXtreme Spectroscopic Survey(PROCESSOS), The Extremely Large Telescope ProjectÂ and others). These systematic efforts have allowed scientists precise positions regarding all visible stellar populations down towards ~25 Million Light Years away accurately measured out into three dimensions enabling detailed mapping projects leading eventually toward identifying close neighbors among themselves",54.34863019,0.001126425,4.8,7.2
What is the Largest Star discovered so far ?,"The largest known star discovered so far is Stephenson 2-18 (St2-18), a red supergiant or red hypergiant star located in the constellation Scutum. It has a size approximately 2,150 times that of the Sun.","As of my knowledge cutoff in September 2021, the largest star known with reasonable certainty and precision measures about 8. AUGUSTUS (8A) or 81 trillion kilometers(49 billion miles)(Zachary Stenfast et al., Sky & Telescope Magazine). It's a red supergiant located at around 16000 light-years from Earth within the constellation Ophiuchus as part of our Milky Way galaxy; it has more than 100 times the Sunâ€™s mass but only spans 1/10th its size making this one extremely massive object compared to other stars we know off! 

However astronomers continue discovering new large galaxies through surveys like Sloan Digital Galaxies Project which could potentially reveal larger still objects yet undiscovered among us including possibly even bigger ""hypergiants"". So while currently recognized by astronomy that observe visible matter using optical telescopes such as ours on earth observing significant changes may be made over time leading up until now when much might have been learned already since I wrote these lines last updated. Always remember though science isn't static - there will always remain room for surprise discoveries especially given how vast universe remains largely unknown despite all advancements thusfar!  So stay curious folks ðŸ˜ŠðŸŒ âœ¨",20.19568586,0.000249773,3.6,3.4
Which planet has the largest Moon in our Solar System and what is it's name ?,"The planet with the largest moon in our Solar System is Jupiter. Its moon, Ganymede, holds the title of the largest moon. Ganymede is even larger than the planet Mercury, with a diameter of about 5,268 kilometers.","To find out which planet has thelargest moon, I will follow these steps: 

1. Acknowledge that you're asking about celestial bodies with moons within Earthâ€™s solar system since there are no more planets left orbiting sun due to its core collapsing millions of years ago as per current scientific consensus (This assumption helps me narrow down my search). 


   Justification for this step - eliminating unnecessary searches from her query by focusing on known facts or widely accepted theories related to astronomy/astrophysics would make searching faster & easier while maintaining accuracy without needing additional data inputting into research process;  

    2) Recall a fact mentioned earlier regarding each planetary body having one primary moon till date discovered until 2021 when NASA began discovering new small icy objects beyond Neptune called ""Kuiper Belt Objects"". So currently we only have knowledge up-to Mars' two large satellites named 'Deimos'. 

     Therefore considering all above information,I can safely state at present every other object besides earth itself including asteroids aren't considered natural satellite systems anymore under most astronomers nowadays unless explicitly stated otherwise... Hence moving ahead based upon available details relevant during writing..
 
 3 ) Review list containing major outer space figures who studied different parts concerning various cosmic structures like stars(Neben), galaxies etc., but also noted prominent Moons around individual Planets such as Jupiter Ganymede being third biggest among them after Io And Callisto respectivelyâ€¦and noticed their sizes compared against some notable terrestrial locations where they could be found : These were mostly near 1st magnitude brightness level indicating relative size comparable roughly equivalent scale between those lunar masses vs surface area areas seen here below ;
